# Alebrije Overview

Alebrijes is a concept created in the last century, the idea behind them is that you can create creatures on your mind and
make them turn alive building their sculptures. You can imagine any features you want your alebrije to have and place
it on their sculptures. These are exercises very common in schools and alebrijes became very popular.

This software is meant to be an exercise to learn the fundamentals of the syntax in the Kotlin programming language. 
It is also meant to share a part of the mexican culture, Alebrije is an interactive game that will allow you create
